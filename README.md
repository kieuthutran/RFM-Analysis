# **1. Overview**
This project aims to develop a customer segmentation model using the RFM analysis for SuperStore, a global retail company. With a vast customer base, the marketing department is looking to implement targeted marketing campaigns to appreciate loyal customers during the upcoming holiday season and identify potential high-value customers.

Given the company's rapid growth, the marketing team has been challenged with manually segmenting the increasing volume of customer data. To address this, the data analytics team has been tasked with creating a Python-based solution to automate the customer segmentation process using the RFM model.

The insights derived from this analysis will enable the marketing team to tailor their campaigns effectively and improve customer retention.

**RFM** is a popular customer segmentation model used in data analysis. It stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.\
  &nbsp;- **Recency**: Measures how recently a customer made a purchase.\
  &nbsp;- **Frequency**: Measures how often a customer makes purchases.\
  &nbsp;- **Monetary**: Measures the total amount a customer spends.

# **2. Tools and Technologies**
   - Global Superstore Transaction Data
   - Python programming language

# **3. Project Proposal**
The following steps will be undertaken:
1) **Data Preparation**: Prepare a dataset suitable for RFM analysis.
2) **RFM Score Calculation**: Determine the calculation method for Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) scores for each customer.
*Note: The reference date for calculating Recency is December 31, 2017.*
3) **Scoring System**: Develop a scoring system with a scale of 1 to 5 for each R, F, and M score.
4) **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers based on their RFM scores using a predefined segmentation table.
5) **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of customer segments across different dimensions.
6) **Current State Analysis**: Analyze the current state of the company based on the segmentation results.
7) **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations for the Marketing and Sales teams, specifically highlighting the most critical RFM metric for SuperStore's retail model.
